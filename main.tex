\section*{Introduction}

As power systems transition towards a greater share of renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar PV, energy systems become increasingly vulnerable to climate variability \parencite{bloomfield2016quantifying}. As a result, there is need for longer range climate forecasting, such as seasonal and decadal forecasts, to inform both the operation and development of these changing power systems. Currently, seasonal forecasts are used to inform management decisions ahead of challenging periods for supply security, such as the winter period \parencite{national_grid_winter_2022}. However, (as far as we know) there is currently no operational usage of decadal (1-10 year) climate forecasts. Decadal forecasts seek to make predictions of the evolution of large-scale climate features over 1-10 years, a key timescale for power system planning and operation. These forecasts could be used, for example, to develop early warning systems for low-wind years, such as the those experienced in Europe during 2021 \parencite{copernicus_climate_change_service_c3s_european_2022}.\\

In order for these decadal forecasts to have value, however, they must show skill. As decadal forecasts quickly lose their predictable signal from initialization, these forecasts are often very noisy \parencite{eade2014seasonal}. As a result, large multi-model ensembles are used to extract the predictable signal in decadal forecasts. However, the models often show underconfidence, where they underestimate the predictability of the real world \parencite{eade2014seasonal}. Despite this, recent techniques outlined in \cite{smith2020north}, such as lagged ensembles and NAO-matching, have improved the skill of decadal forecasts of large modes of variability, such as the NAO and AMV.\\

As research has demonstrated the value of seasonal forecasts for the european energy-sector \parencite{clark2017skilful,thornton2019skilful}, there is potential for decadal forecasts to provide value at longer timescales, particularly with the recent findings of surprising skill in decadal NAO forecasts \parencite{smith2020north}.

\section*{Literature Review}

Predictability on decadal timescales derives from slowly varying, often large-scale, modes of variability; such as the El Ni√±o-Southern Oscilation (ENSO) or the Atlantic Multidecadal variability (AMV) \parencite{smith2012current}. Decadal forecasts aim to predict changes in climate and the frequency of extremes by resolving the evolution of these drivers on timescales of 1-10 years \parencite{eade2012forecasting}. The temporal variability in these forecasts can be divided into two components; the predictable component tied to predictable modes of variability (the signal) and the unpredictable component resulting from the chaotic nature of the atmosphere (the noise) \parencite{eade2014seasonal}. Uncertainty in decadal forecasts therefore depends on the size of the predictable signal relative to the unpredictable noise (signal-to-noise ratio), among other factors. As a result, large ensembles are used to assess and quantify the uncertainty in these forecasts. \\

At seasonal and decadal timescales, numerous experiments have demonstrated the low strength of predictable signals in climate models and the unexpected high correlation with observations (given small signal-to-noise ratios) \parencite{eade2014seasonal,riddle2013cfsv2,scaife2014skillful,kang2014prediction,dunstone2016skilful,smith2020north,marcheggiani2023decadal}. This is known as the signal-to-noise paradox, which occurs when ensemble predictions from climate models show higher correlation with obsevations than their individual ensemble members \parencite{scaife2018signal}.Hence, the predictable component in models is smaller than in reality, when looking at modes of variability such as the NAO \parencite{smith2020north,dunstone2016skilful}, AO \parencite{riddle2013cfsv2,kang2014prediction} and the eddy-driven jet \parencite{marcheggiani2023decadal}.\\

Large multi-model ensembles were used to create decadal hindcasts of the NAO and AMV in \cite{smith2020north}. The moderate skill in the raw ensemble output was amplified using two techniques; increasing the ensemble size by lagging the forecasts (and adjusting the variance) and by subselecting members which have the required magnitude of NAO (NAO-matching) \parencite{smith2020north}. This demonstrated that decadal forecast skill in the North Atlantic could be amplified by reducing the noise (by lagging the ensemble) or increasing the predictable signal (through NAO-matching). However, recent results from \cite{marcheggiani2023decadal} have show that this skill may be sensitive to the period over which it is assessed; which statistically significant reductions in skill for the NAO index when assessed over the longer period from 1960-2012 insted of the shorter period from 1960-2005. They propose that this drop in skill can be explained by the DCPP-A models failing to capture a return to positive NAO indexes associated with a stronger and warmer jet as well as also failing to capture recent cooling of the subpolar North Atlantic \parencite{marcheggiani2023decadal}.\\


In order to provide value to the energy-sector from decadal forecasts, the skill in large-scale phenomena must be translated into skill for relevant surface variables, such as surface temperature, wind speeds and incoming solar radiation. In \cite{moemken2016decadal} they explored the relative skill of raw output for surface wind from decadal forecasts and compared to statistically-dynamically downscaled surface winds diagnosed from pressure fields.
